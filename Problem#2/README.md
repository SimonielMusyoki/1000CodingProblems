### Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i is the product of all numbers in the original array except one at index i

### For example, if our input was [1,2,3,4,5], the expected output would be  [120,60,40,30,24]. If the output was [3,2,1], the expected output would be [2,3,6]
